The M3i Zero (GMP-Z003 version) is the last Slot-1 flashcart from the M3 Adapter team. As the M3 team stopped updating Sakura around 2011, the Sakura kernel is unable to play quite a few games that were released later on in the DS lifespan. Unfrotunately, The M3 team made booting alternate kernels extremely difficult on the GMP-Z003, so Sakura/Touchpod is currently the best choice on this cart.

While this cart does supports SDHC SD cards, Sakura/TouchPod has issues with cards that are 64GB or larger. The nds loader will simply refuse to load games, or load the game but crash/freeze soon after.
