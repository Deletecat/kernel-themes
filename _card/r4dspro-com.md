This flashcard will use BL2CK OS as it is based on the R4 Ultra. However, this flashcard will not work with TwiLight Menu ++, meaning that your only options are BL2CK or the stock kernel (which doesn't have great game compatibility).

This flashcard is also being sold without a label on AliExpress.
