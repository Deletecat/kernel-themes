This family of flashcarts are DSTTi-based clones that ship with a timebomb in the stock kernel. This timebomb doesn't cause any permanent damage - it simply stops the kernel from booting until the date is set back. It can be bypassed by using YSMenu or the no-timebomb version of the stock kernel. YSMenu is recommended since the stock kernel has issues with cheats, and doesn't have folder support for file management.

{% include kernels/ysmenu.md timebomb="true" %}
