This card is a clone of R4iTT's Acekard-based flashcards. All r4isdhc.hk cards from 2014-2019 will use BL2CK OS as their kernel. Most 2020 cards are based on the R4iLS cards, however, some are still based on R4iTT cards.

**Do not** attempt to use YSMenu or TTMenu on this flashcard, attempting to launch them will **brick** your flashcard!
