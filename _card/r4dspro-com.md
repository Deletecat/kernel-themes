This flashcart will use BL2CK OS as it is based on the R4 Ultra. However, this flashcart will not work with TwiLight Menu ++, meaning that your only options are BL2CK or the stock kernel (which doesn't have great game compatibility).

This flashcart is also being sold without a label on AliExpress.

Do not attempt to run YSMenu on this flashcart, doing so will cause it to **brick**!
