This flashcart is a half-baked clone of the DSOne SDHC. YSMenu or RGF's TTMenu repack is the best kernel to use on this cart as it has the most up-to-date loaders and patches available. To set it up, copy the contents of `DSTTi Clone YSMenu` (or `TTMenu` for RGF's repack of it) folder from RetroGameFan's YSMenu archive to the root of your microSD card.

Note that while YSMenu is pretty reliable when it comes to retail games, it often fails to load romhacks. If you want to play romhacks on this cart, using TWiLight Menu++ with nds-bootstrap as a dual-boot kernel is suggested. To set it up, follow steps 1-6 of the [TWiLight Menu guide](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/twilightmenu/installing-flashcard). Afterwards, simply launch BOOT.NDS in the menu to load into TWiLight.
