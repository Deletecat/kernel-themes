The original R4 is limited to microSD cards only (up to 2GB in capacity). The best kernel to use on it would be `Wood R4 1.62` as the stock kernel isn't great to use.

1:1 clones of the original R4 are still being sold on AliExpress. However, it is not recommended to buy them due to the lack of SDHC support.
