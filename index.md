This site aims to be a visual guide to the [Flashcard Archive](https://flashcard-archive.ds-homebrew.com). Not every flashcart is listed yet so you may need to visit the Flashcard Archive's main site to find the kernel for your cart. Each cart has been categorised by the manufacturer and any common kernels which it may use.

[Click here to go to the flashcard list](/card/).
