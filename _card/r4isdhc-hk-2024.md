This flashcard is a relabelled version of the `R4DS Pro` cards. It will use BL2CK OS just like the regular `R4DS Pro` cards. However, this flashcard will not work with TwiLight Menu ++, meaning that your only options are BL2CK or the stock kernel which doesn't have great game compatibility.

This flashcard can be found with three different labels:
+ Gold Pro
+ RTS Lite
+ Dual Core

There are no differences between them besides a different shell colour and label.
