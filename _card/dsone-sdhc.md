Clones are common on AliExpress and eBay at the moment, howevery they have a high dead on arrival rate.

Using YSMenu is only recommended if your card has a PSRAM error and cannot use EOS. To check if your DSOne SDHC has a faulty PSRAM, hold L and R on boot to run the DSOne's self-test. The self-test feature was removed on the DSOnei.
