This site aims to be a visual guide to the [flashcard-archive](https://flashcard-archive.ds-homebrew.com). Not every flashcart is listed yet so you may need to visit the flashcard-archive's main site to find the kernel for your cart.

Each cart has been categorised by the manufacturer and any common kernels which it may use.

[Click here to go to the flashcard list](/card/).
