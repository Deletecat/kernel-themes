The original Ace3DS was a DSTT clone. As such, it will use YSMenu. To set it up, copy the `DSTTi Clone YSMenu` files from RetroGameFan's Multi Cart repack to the root of your microSD card. Then, make a copy of `TTMenu.dat` and rename it to `3DSCARD.dat`.

**DO NOT** run the original TTMenu as it will **brick** your flashcard!
